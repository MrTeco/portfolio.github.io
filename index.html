                    I always liked to program things whether it were logic components in sandbox games or mods, but the Python language is what got me into real programming.
                    For some time I messed around with Python and then stopped, but then in 2019 I started learning C# and Unity because I wanted to make my own game, and I learned a lot since then. I got into various projects like Discord bots and mods for games. Recently I also started learnign C++ and OpenGl and made a little project with it.
                    I like GameDev because I can create worlds and experiences that others can think about and immerse in, like seperate universes that I get to create.

                    I started this project in late 2019 when I got really interested in Space Station 13, I took a lot of inspiration from that game and decided to create
                    something unique that I can play with others. I made this using Unity and the Mirror Networking asset which allowed me to semi-easily implement multiplayer.
                    I always wanted a very "grimdark" atmosphere type of game with horror and survival elements, so I took inspiraton from things like the Navajo Skinwalker folklore and other games with a similar feel.
                    I hope that I can one day get a small active community of players that I can play with where the community gets to shape the world in a way.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent a LOT of time on this project, and I want to continue advancing on it until it becomes a fully fledged fun and enjoyable game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Unity project is getting pretty large, and I've considered switching to my own game engine before. So it does sometimes get a little too bloated but new coding practices I learn and things such as ECS - Entity Component System structure help me out.

                <p>
                    This is a plugin for a game called Barotrauma, I made it when I realized that the game is made in C#, open-source and mod friendly. It offers players a new experience, because it features things like added custom gamemodes, quality of life features like chat commands and currency, and sometimes completely changes how the game works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And cadmiumbot is the Discord Bot that I made, it reads the clients points on a .txt file on my pc, and displays a leaderboard in a Discord channel. I made it by using "discord.net" which are like C# bindings for making bots and using the bot api.

                <p>
                    This is one that I started very recently, start of 2022. I got interested in creating games without Unity or other game engines so I started learning how to render things in OpenGL and decided to use a library called OpenTK. I got the idea to make a bullet hell type of game inspired by Touhou, because it's pretty simple. My progress so far is a simple moving image that shoots bullets.
                    But I will continue working on it until it has a core gameplay loop, then Ill see if I want to continue making it more interesting or move on to something else.
